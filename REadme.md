# Guesserv1

This is a nice and simple guessing game that I used to get better with Javscript arrays and loops.

It comes with a simple app UI that allows you to guess words. It also includes the hangman game if you want to play it.

It also has an animal guessing game with many animals! Get a hint and then guess the animal's name.
